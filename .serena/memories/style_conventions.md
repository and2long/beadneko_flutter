# Style and Conventions

- Lint rules: uses `package:flutter_lints/flutter.yaml` via `analysis_options.yaml`.
- Follow standard Dart/Flutter conventions (lower_snake_case for file names, UpperCamelCase for types, lowerCamelCase for variables/functions).
- Keep UI simple and friendly per `docs/FEATURES.md` (pink/blue-green gradient, rounded buttons, cute iconography).
